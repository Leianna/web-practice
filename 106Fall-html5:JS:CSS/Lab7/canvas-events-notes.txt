1.0  Canvas Events Project Folder
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example project folder for understanding and using events.

    canvas-events.html 
    css/canvas-events.css 
    js/canvas-events.js
    canvas-events-notes.txt

We will walk through setting up event handlers and experiment with events related to interactions from the Mouse, the Keyboard and HTML objects (buttons).

1.1  Introduction to Events
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The browser can capture multiple events:

- mouse events:  location; in and out; click
- keyboard events:  key press
- object loading events
- ....

See:  http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp

To capture these events, the browser allows us to listen for events by calling a function when an event occurs and passing the function an object for the event.

See:  http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp

To handle events we need to add an event handler to our JS code:

    object.addEventListener( event, myEventFunction, useCapture );

And then also add an associated function() to be called when the event occurs.

    function myEventFunction( e ) {

        ...handling it...

    }

This function accepts the parameter "e" which the event object.  The event object provides us access to what occurred.


1.2  Scaffolding for Events
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The building block for events are:

(1) What event are we listening for?

(2) What object are we listening on?

(3) What function are we going to call when the event occurs?

It is good practice to setup the following basic scaffolding to ensure that your events are listened for, heard and action is taken. 

Step 1: Add the event listener

    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //event listeners
    object.addEventListener( "event", eventFunction , true );    


Step 2:  Setup the function that gets called

    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //event handler function
    function eventFunction( e ) {    

        console.log( "eventFunction()" );
        
        //event specific code goes here
        ....
        
    } //eventFunction()

We can test that this works by activating the event and then checking the console to see of the eventFunction() has been called.

Note, you need to define the "event" and the "object" in the addEventListener.

2.0  Mouse Events
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To explore mouse events we going to use a simple example of drawing a single circle.  The circle has a specific size and color and is drawn in the center of the canvas.

We will then explore how to:

* have the circle move based on the mouse movement
* have the circle change color when the mouse is clicked

2.1  Setup 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a cleared canvas draw a filled circle of a specific size in the center of the canvas.

Our program is setup with the following:

    canvasApp() {

        - setup canvas variables
        
        - setup circle variables

        function drawCircle() 
            - draw a circle 

        function clearCanvas() 
            - clear the canvas

        function drawCanvas() 
            - draw the circle

        - call drawCanvas()
    
    }

2.2  Mouse Movement Event 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first part is to see if we can:

* Have the circle change location based on the movement of the mouse.

OK to get started lets go through the building block for events:

(1) what event are we listening for?

Lets look and see what type of events are related to the mouse:

    http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp

Looks like we may be able to use  use "mousemove" as our event

    http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onmousemove.asp
    
Our event listener starts to look like:

    object.addEventListener( "mousemove", eventFunction , true );    

(2) What object are we listening on?

When or where do we want the know when the mouse moves?  In other words, on which object or element do we want to know when the mouse moves?

We are only concerned with mouse movement when the mouse is over the canvas.  

How is the canvas defined on our page?  Using the <canvas> tag, yes.  But how is it defined?  By using an ID, which in our case is "myCanvas".

Using the "object" "myCanvas" our event listener starts to look like:

    myCanvas.addEventListener( "mousemove", eventFunction , true );    

(3) What function are we going to call when the event occurs

Lets follow the convention where we name the function eventX where X is the type of event.  

So in our case this would be:

    eventMouseMove
    
Using the function name  "eventMouseMove" our event listener starts to look like:

    myCanvas.addEventListener( "mousemove", eventMouseMove , true );  
    
OK.  All three questions answered so lets go setup our event scaffolding.    


2.2.1  Mouse Movement Event - Scaffolding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lets setup the the basic scaffolding for our event and test that its all hooked up and working.

(A)  Add the event listener

    myCanvas.addEventListener( "mousemove", eventMouseMove , true );    

This should generate a JS error in our console!  Because we have not setup the function yet.

(B)  Add the event function

    function eventMouseMove( e ) {

        console.log( "eventMouseMove()" );
        
    }//eventMouseMove

Note, event handler functions all get passed a parameter which is the event object.  We will call that parameter "e" for "event".

Our parameter "e" is an object that has properties and methods associated with the event.  This is where we will find the mouses current location.    

(C) Test it

Save, reload and check the console.

When you move the mouse you should see a console message:

>eventMouseMove()

Ok. Now we are ready to move onto getting the mouse location and seeing how we can use that to change our circle.

2.2.2  Mouse Movement Event - Get the Mouse Coords
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

With our event scaffolding setup, we are capturing the mouse movement. Now we need to figure out how to, or where to, get access to something defines the mouse location as it moves.

(A) Getting the mouse location

We are looking for something that provides the position of the mouse.  How is a mouse location defined?  I bet its defined as something like its X and Y coords on the screen.

We can look here to see what properties are available to us in the Event Object (scroll down to the "MouseEvent Object" section).

    http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp

Looks like we can use "clientX" and "clientY".    

Well almost. For the canvas object the mouse coordinates are a bit tricky. So we actually want to use "offsetX" and "offsetY" - these tell us the location of the mouse as "offset" within the canvas.  (Note, this does not work on all browsers - so be sure you are using Chrome.)  

Ok lets try these.  To see what values these produce lets print their values in our console message.  We can reference these values from our "e" object.

    console.log( "mouseMove():" + e.offsetX + ":" +  e.offsetY );
        
Save, reload, move the mouse and check the console.  Looks like these provide the X and Y inside out canvas.  Great.

(B) Using the coords to move the circle

Now that we have the mouse X and Y coordinates inside the canvas, what can we do with them?  Or, how can we use them to change the location of the circle?

How is our circle position defined? By the center point of the circle with X and Y coordinates.

Lets use the event mouse X and Y to change circle X and Y.  We can do this by:

    circle.x = e.offsetX;
    circle.y = e.offsetY;

Add this to our eventMoveMouse function.

Ok great. Nothing happens.  Why?  

By using the offsetX and offsetY we are moving the defined location of the circle X and Y.  

But to see the new defined position we also need to re-draw the circle.  

But where in our algorithm do we draw the circle?

    //draw the the canvas
    drawCanvas();

Cool.  The circle follows the mouse.

What happens if we clear the canvas before we draw?

    //clear the canvas
    clearCanvas();

    //draw the circle
    drawCircle();

Also cool.

2.2.3  Mouse Movement Event - Finished Code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this exercise we have demonstrated how to:

- add an event listener
- create an function to handle the event

Final code looks something like:

    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // clear canvas
    function clearCanvas() { 
        
        // set a fill style of white
        context.fillStyle= canvasColor;

        // fill the while canvas with the fill style
        context.fillRect(0, 0, canvasWidth , canvasHeight);

    } //  clearCanvas()
    
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //draw the canvas
    function drawCanvas() {

        //clear the canvas
        clearCanvas();

        //draw the circle
        drawCircle();
        
    }//drawCanvas()

    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //get the mouse coordinates
    function eventMouseMove( e ) {
        
        console.log( e.offsetX + ":" +  e.offsetY );
                
        circle.x = e.offsetX;
        circle.y = e.offsetY;
                
        //draw the circle
        drawCanvas( );
        
    } //eventMouseMove()
    
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // Attach an event handler to the document
    myCanvas.addEventListener( "mousemove", eventMouseMove, true );


Our example is a bit simple.  And could use a little cleaning up.  

Lets:

- Move the actual movement of the circle (the changing of the X and Y to a function; in case we need todo other things when we move the circle).

- And instead of drawCircle() we will drawCanvas() when the circle has moved; and have drawCanvas() call clearCanvas() and drawCircle().

    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //draw the canvas
    function drawCanvas() {
         
        //clear the canvas
        clearCanvas();
        
        //draw the circle
        drawCircle();
        
    } //drawCanvas()
    //-----------------------------------------------------------


    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //move the circle location with the mouse coords
    function eventMouseMove( e ) {

        //make sure it is listening
        console.log( "eventMouseMove():" + e.offsetX + ":" +  e.offsetY );
        
        //change the location of the circle
        circle.x = e.offsetX;
        circle.y = e.offsetY;
        
        //re-draw the canvas
        drawCanvas();
        
    }//eventMouseMove
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    //listen for the mouse moving
    myCanvas.addEventListener( "mousemove", eventMouseMove , true );    
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
        
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // draw the canvas  
    drawCanvas();
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
